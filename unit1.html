        <h2 ><B><I>1.HISTORY OF WWW</I></B></h2>
        <P>Tim Berners-Lee, a British scientist, invented the World Wide Web (WWW) in 1989, while working at CERN. The Web was originally conceived and developed to meet the demand for automated information-sharing between scientists in universities and institutes around the world.

</P>            <p>CERN is not an isolated laboratory, but rather the focal point for an extensive community that includes more than 17 000 scientists from over 100 countries. Although they typically spend some time on the CERN site, the scientists usually work at universities and national laboratories in their home countries. Reliable communication tools are therefore essential.

            The basic idea of the WWW was to merge the evolving technologies of computers, data networks and hypertext into a powerful and easy to use global information system.</P>
    <h2> <B><i>2. EVOLUTION OF HTML</i></B></h2>
<P> HTML was created by Sir Tim Berners-Lee in late 1991 but was not officially released. It was published in 1995 as HTML 2.0. HTML 4.01 was published in late 1999 and was a major version of HTML.</P>
HTML 1.0 was released in 1993 with the intention of sharing information that can be readable and accessible via web browsers. But not many of the developers were involved in creating websites. So the language was also not growing.
Then comes HTML 2.0, published in 1995, which contains all the features of HTML 1.0 along with a few additional features, which remained the standard markup language for designing and creating websites until January 1997 and refined various core features of HTML.
Then comes HTML 3.0, where Dave Raggett introduced a fresh paper or draft on HTML. It included improved new features of HTML, giving more powerful characteristics for webmasters in designing web pages. But these powerful features of the new HTML slowed down the browser in applying further improvements.
Then comes HTML 4.01, which is widely used and was a successful version of HTML before HTML 5.0, which is currently released and used worldwide. HTML 5 can be said for an extended version of HTML 4.01, which was published in the year 2012.</p>
<h2><B><i>3. DIFFERENT HTML VERSIONS</i></B></h2>
<P>The various major versions of HTML are as follows:</P>
    <p><u><b>1. HTML 1.0</b></u></p>
    <p>One of the first versions of HTML, HTML 1.0, was released in 1993, laying down the foundations for building web pages. Some of its primary characteristics were:</p>
    
    <p>Structuring Elements: HTML 1.0 introduced elements that made it possible to add structure to the content on web pages. These included headings, lists, paragraphs, and images.</p>
    <p>Comparatively Simpler: HTML 1.0 was very simple in comparison to later versions of HTML. It didn’t have styling options or the ability to control how content would display in a web browser. Additionally, HTML 1.0 lacked any support for tables.</p>
    <p>Font Support: Although HTML 1.0 introduced fonts, it was limited. In other words, there was minimal scope for changing the text style or size.</p>
    <p>Nonetheless, HTML 1.0 initiated the field of web development, and its features kept advancing with every updated version.</p>

<p><u><b>2. HTML 2.0</b></u></p>
    <p>The HTML 2.0 version was released in 1995 and had considerable improvements from the previous version. Some of them were:</p>
    
    <p>Standardization of HTML: This version made HTML into a standard by establishing common rules and regulations that all web browsers had to follow.</p>
    <p>Forms: Most importantly, HTML 2.0 introduced the concept of forms, which allowed users to input data on web pages. However, the forms were still basic and only contained text boxes and buttons.</p>
    <p>Tables: HTML 2.0 introduced the <table> tag for creating tabular data on web pages, contributing to better organization of data.</p>
    <p>Formation of the W3C: During HTML 2.0, browsers started making their own tags, because of which there was inconsistency across different browsers. To resolve the issue and establish standardization, the W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) was formed. This helped web browsers to render tags in a consistent manner.</p>
   <P><u><b>3. HTML 3.2</b></u></P>
   <P> HTML 3.2 was the next major successor to HTML 2.0 and was developed in 1997. The updated features included in it are:</P>
 <P>Upgraded Form Elements: HTML 3.2 brought better ways to create interactive forms on websites. Developers could make forms that were more interactive and dynamic for users.</P>
   <P>CSS Support: Another important feature included in HTML 3.2 was support for CSS (Cascading Style Sheets). It helped designers improve the look of web pages by styling and customizing HTML elements.</P>
    <P>Enhanced Image Features: Handling images became easier with HTML 3.2. It allowed for better control over image size, alignment, and text descriptions.</P>
    <P>Extended Character Set: HTML 3.2 also expanded the available characters for web pages. It included special symbols and international characters for a more diverse presentation of the content. </P>
<P><u><b>4. HTML 4.01</b></u></P>
<P>HTML 4.01, released in 1999, brought several advancements to the HTML language. Here are some of the updated features: </P>
<P>CSS Linking: Previously, one had to place CSS on each page to apply the styles. However, with 4.01, CSS files could be linked and included in each HTML page using the < link> tag. This helped maintain consistent styles across web pages without repeating CSS code.</P>
   <P> New Tags: HTML 4.01 also introduced some new tags like “< fieldset>”, “< header>”, “< footer>”, and “< legend>”. These tags consequently enhanced the presentability of the content.</p>
   <p>Table Enhancement: In addition, HTML 4.01 made tables more powerful. We could use attributes like 'colspan' and 'rowspan' to make cells in a table span across multiple columns or rows. This made it easier to create more complicated and interesting tables. </P>
<P><u><b> 5. XHTML 1.0</b></u></P>
<P> XHTML 1.0 stands for Extensible HyperText Markup Language 1.0 and was released in 2000.</P>
<P> Strict Standards and Compatibility: XHTML 1.0 is similar to HTML but has a stricter version with more stringent rules for elements, attributes, and syntax. Due to such strict criteria, a common standard was created for web pages. This reduced the scope for incompatibility between browsers.</P>
   <P> Compatibility with XML: XHTML 1.0 offered compatibility with XML tools. It meant that XML parsing libraries and transformation tools, commonly used for working with XML documents, could also be utilized with XHTML documents.</P>
    <P>Future Adaptability: Furthermore, XHTML 1.0 documents were easily adaptable to any future versions of HTML or XML without any significant changes.</P>
    <P><u><b>6. HTML5</b></u></P>
    <p>WHATWG released the initial public draft of HTML5 in 2008, but it officially became a W3C recommendation on October 28, 2014. The version brought extensive support for new HTML tags. Furthermore, HTML5 provided support for new form elements like input elements of different types and geolocations support tags, etc.</p>
    
    <p>Here are some key features and tags added in HTML5:</p>
    
    <p>New Form Elements: One important addition was the < input type=”email”> tag, which confirms whether the user input is a valid email address. Likewise, another form element was the < input type=”password”> tag, which was designed to capture passwords securely. The browser displayed special symbols as user input in the password field, thereby protecting the password from being revealed.</p>
    <p>Audio Tag: HTML5 introduced the < audio> tag, allowing developers to embed audio content directly into web pages. This tag enabled the seamless integration of audio clips and allowed playing audio directly on the webpage.</p>
    <p>Semantic Tags: Semantic tags, also known as structural tags, provide organization and structure to HTML pages. These tags provided a clearer hierarchy and meaning to different sections of a webpage. A few of the semantic tags introduced in HTML5 include < figcaption>, < header>, < footer>, etc. These tags also helped enhance the accessibility and search engine optimization of the webpage.</p>
    <p> Section Tag: The < section> tag defines a distinct section within an HTML page. This helps in organizing and delineating content, thereby providing logical divisions within the webpage.</p>
    <H2><B><I>4. WHY HTML5?</I></B></H2>
    <p>HTML 5 is the latest Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), the standard programming language for describing the contents and appearance of Web pages.</p>

       <p> These days all major browsers (Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Opera, and IE) offer HTML5 support, which makes it the newest HTML technology used today.</p>
        
       <p> Here's a list of some amazing benefits of HTML5:</p>
        
        <p><b>1. Cross-Browser Compatibility</b></p>
        
        <p>HTML5 is easy to implement and it works with CSS3. Today all browsers support HTML5 tags and even IE6 understands the markup <!doctype html> and will render the pages correctly.</p>
        
        <p><b>2. New DOCTYPE declaration</b></p>
        
        <p>The most important fact about HTML 5 is - HTML5 is easy to implement and it works with CSS3</p>
        <p>The DOCTYPE declaration for HTML5 is very simple:</p>
        <p><! DOCTYPE html></p>
        <P>Yes, just the two words “DOCTYPE” and “html” and no more long lines of unreadable code filled with dirty tags.</P>
        
        <P><b>3. Bring improvements in usability and user experience</b></P>
        
       <P> Usability and user experience related to how well a website or app is designed. We all want better dynamic websites and great-looking apps that interact with the user and allows the user to enjoy the functionality, content, etc. instead of just looking at it. HTML5 has several technical enhancements and improved features for web And with HTML5 code, web developer can easily design better applications and dynamic websites which result in better user experience and usability.</P>
        
       <P><b>4. Alternative to Flash and Silver light</b></P>
        
        <P>HTML5 exceeds Flash and Silver light and takes the lead just because for playing the Flash file and Silver light, you will need to install Adobe Flash latest version or a Silver light plugin and you also need to keep in mind the device and the operating system compatibility. This is not the case with HTML 5. As a result, HTML5 is becoming more popular these days with companies as it offers a massive set of attributes and functions that help web developers to build beautiful websites and apps with minimum work.</P>
        
        <P><b>5. Heavily used for mobile apps and games</b></P>
        
        <P>The adaptability of HTML5 in mobile applications and game development increases as the HTML5 web application tool gives more flexibility to the web developer in all cases starting from the User interface (UI), development, using scripts, and others.</P>
        
        <P>HTML5 is also capable of handling multimedia content without the necessity of installing plugins, and we can easily develop interactive games with this technology.</P>
        
        <P><b>6. Clean markup and Improved Code</b></P>
        
       <P> HTML5 has come along with clean markup and clean code that make it more accessible than the previous version. HTML 5 allows the web developer and web designer to use neater code and remove div tag and replace all the div tags with new HTML 5 elements.</P>
        
        <P><b>7. Offline Browsing</b></P>
        
        <P>HTML5 also offers offline browsing, which means that visitors can load certain elements on a web page without an active internet connection. Assume you’ve visited the site and somehow you are not connected to the internet now or internet connection happens to go down. With HTML5 offline caching we can still load core elements of the websites and you can view them offline.</P>
        
       <P><b> 8. HTML5 Is SEO-friendly when it comes to website crawling and indexing</b></P>
        
        <P>Nowadays to gain and retain top rankings in different search engines including Google, the website must be optimized with care and all necessary SEO modules. HTML 5 comes with various attributes and modules that make it easy for web crawlers to search your content and getting it indexed properly, thereby increasing its rankings in search engine search results pages. HTML5’s technology provides various features with a wide range of structural elements, semantics, form types, new attributes, and media elements making it easier for digital marketing experts and developers to focus on better search engine optimization techniques and to drive more organic search traffic.</P>
        
       <P><b> 9. Video and Audio Support</b></P>
        
       <P> With HTML5 technology, we no longer need to rely upon third-party plugins in order to render audio and videos. You can forget about Flash Player and other third-party media players and plugins. You can make your videos and audio easily accessible with the new HTML5 < video> and < audio> tags.</p>
        
       <P> Where earlier you would have to use the old < embed> and < object> tags and assign a huge list of parameters just to display the video visible and working correctly. But with HTML5’s video and audio tags we can treat them as images; < video src=”url”/>.</p>
        
       <P> We have to just define parameters like height, width and autoplay in the single line tag just like any other HTML element: < video src=”url” width=”800px” height=”500px” autoplay/>.</P>
        
       <P><b>10. Geolocation Support</b></P>
        
        <P>With the help of Geolocation, we can easily find out where we are in the world and easily share that information with people.</P>
        
        <P>In the past if we want to detect the location of a client device first we have to look at the client IP address, your wireless network connection, cell tower of your phone and latitude, and longitude. But with HTML5, a set of APIs have been developed which effectively allow the client-side device (i.e. your phones, IP, or even your desktop browsers) to retrieve geographic positioning information with JavaScript directly available to your HTML5-compatible browser.</P>
        
        <P>HTML5 improves and enhances the browsing experience. So why don't you adopt HTML 5 for your website and mobile apps?</P>
        
<H2> <B> <I>5. HTML4 VS HTML5</I></B></H2>
<P> HTML is the base language that makes up most of the web pages and online applications. Like other programming languages, HTML has been updated several times over years. HTML5 is the current version of HTML that brings many new and advanced features and improvements over its predecessor, i.e. HTML4. Let's understand more!</P>
         <P>HTML 4 and HTML 5 are two versions of the HyperText Markup Language (HTML), which is the standard language used to create and design web pages and web applications. In this blog, we will see the differences between them in detail.</P>

<h2> <b> <i>6. HTML5 NEW FEATURES</i></b></h2>
<P> HTML5 is the fifth revision of the Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), which is the standard markup language for creating webpages and applications on the World Wide Web. It was developed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG) as an evolution of its predecessor, HTML4.</P>

<p>Following are the new features in HTML5 :</p>
<p> <b>1.Semantics:</b> HTML5 introduced several new elements that provide better semantic meaning to web content. These include < header>, < footer>, < nav>, < article>, < section>, < aside>, < figure>, and < figcaption>. These elements make it easier for search engines and assistive technologies to understand the structure and purpose of the content.</p>

<p><b>2. Multimedia Support:</b> HTML5 added native support for multimedia elements, eliminating the need for plugins like Adobe Flash. The < audio> and < video> elements allow developers to embed audio and video content directly into web pages. The new < canvas> element enables dynamic rendering of graphics, animations, and visual effects using JavaScript.</p>
    
 <p> <b>3. Form Enhancements:</b> HTML5 introduced new input types and attributes to enhance web forms. Some examples include < input type=”email”> for email addresses, < input type=”url”> for URLs, < input type=”date”> for date input, < input type=”range”> for sliders, and < input type=”color”> for color pickers. Additionally, the < datalist> element provides a list of predefined options for form fields.</p>

   <p><b>4. Offline and Storage:</b> HTML5 introduced the Application Cache (`< appcache>`) mechanism, enabling web applications to work offline or with a slow internet connection. It also introduced the Web Storage API (`localStorage` and sessionStorage), allowing web applications to store data locally on the client's browser.</p>
    
   <p><b> 5. Geolocation:</b> HTML5 introduced the Geolocation API, which enables web applications to access the user's geographic location with their consent. This feature has been widely used for location-based services and applications.</p>
    
    <p><b>6. Drag and Drop:</b> HTML5 introduced a standardized Drag and Drop API, making it easier to implement drag-and-drop functionality within web applications without relying on third-party libraries.

    <p><b>7. Improved Accessibility:</b>HTML5 introduced various attributes and elements to improve web accessibility. These include the role attribute, aria-* attributes for defining accessible roles and properties, and < figure> and < figcaption> elements for providing alternative descriptions for images and multimedia content.</P>
    <h2> <b> <i>7. BROWSER SUPPORTS</i></b></h2>
<P>HTML5 is supported by all the major browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Opera, as well as iOS for Chrome and Safari and Android browsers. It can even work with the older and less popular browsers like Internet Explorer.</P>
<h2> <b> <i>8.BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY </i></b></h2>
<P> HTML5 is designed, as much as possible, to be backward compatible with existing all major web browsers. New features build on existing features and allow you to provide fallback content for older browsers.</P>
