<h2><b><i>1.WHAT IS CSS ? </i></b></h2>

<P>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.</P>
<p>CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media.</p>
<p>CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once.</p>
<p>External stylesheets are stored in CSS files.</P>
<P>CSS is a rule-based language â€” you define the rules by specifying groups of styles that should be applied to particular elements or groups of elements on your web page.</P>
<h2><b><i>2.HISTORY OF CSS</i></b></h2>
<P>"Like HTML, CSS is standardized by the W3 consortium. CSS is an open, independent and freely usable standard. As with HTML, a working group exists for CSS who concerns itself with development of the standard. This is being done in accordance with W3C rules.</P>

   <P> CSS comes in different versions. CSS level 1 was released in 1996, and republished with corections in 1999. CSS level 2 appeared in 1998 and built on CSS level 1. CSS level 2 adds support for different output media. CSS 3 is currently in development and will be split up in modules.</P>
    
    <P>The idea behind it was to seperate presentation and content of a web site. The advantage of this approach is that updates and changes to the presentation need only be applied once (to the stylesheet) to affect all pages. Especially large sites can achieve significant time savings. In order to enforce this separation of concerns, the W3C has deprecated the < font> tag in HTML 4. Newer (X)HTML versions will deprecate other tags in a similar vein.</p>
    
    <P>CSS stylesheets are an immediate addition to HTML. CSS is a language to define format properties of HTML or XML tags. HTML has reached the end of it's shelf life and is not being developed further. XHTML is the new standard instead. XHTML reformulates HTML with XML syntax while at the same time getting rid of presentational markup. XHTML only contains content, presentation is the domain of a CSS stylesheet. This allows for different stylesheets for different output formats such as print, aural or small devices. Search machines on the other hand have an easier job if they are only presented with content markup." </P>
<h2><b><i>3.VERSIONS OF CSS</i></b></h2>
<P>There are three versions of CSS- CSS1, CSS2 and CSS3. CSS1 is the oldest dating back to 1996 and CSS3 is the latest which contains fresh features and functionalities.</P>
<P>CSS 1 was adapted in 1996. It was difficult and less adapted by then recent browsers such as Internet Explorer 3, Internet Explorer 4 and Netscape 4.x.</P>
<P>CSS2 is the improvement of CSS1. It removed the not fully interoperable features. It also included the browser extensions.</P>
<P>CSS3 is the most recent and currently used. It has XHTML specification. CSS3 has its major focus on modularisation and separation of concerns.</P>
<H2><B><I>4.BROWSER SUPPORT</I></B></H2>
<P>The Css are supported in browsers:</P>
<ul>
<li><p>Chrome</p></li>
<li><p>Firefox</p></li>
<li><p>Internet Explorer</p></li>
<li><P>Opera</P></li></ul>
<H2><B><I>5.WHAT'S NEW IN CSS3</I></B></H2>
<P>The new features in CSS3 include box shadow, opacity, rounded corners, attribute selectors, new colours and more fonts.</P>

<h2><b><i>7.TYPES OF CSS</i></b></h2>
<P>CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</P>
<ul><li><p><b>Inline -</li></b> by using the style attribute inside HTML elements</p>
<p><li><b>Internal -</li></b> by using a < style> element in the < head> section</p>
<p><b><li>External -</li></b>by using a < link> element to link to an external CSS file</P></ul>
<ul><P><b>Inline CSS-</b></p>
<li><p> An inline CSS is used to apply a unique style to a single HTML element.</li></p>
<p><li>An inline CSS uses the style attribute of an HTML element.</li></p>
<P><b>Internal CSS</b>-</p>
<p><li>An internal CSS is used to define a style for a single HTML page.</li></p>
<p><li>An internal CSS is defined in the < head> section of an HTML page, within a < style> element.</li></p>
<P><b>External CSS-</b></p>
<p><li> An external style sheet is used to define the style for many HTML pages.</li></p>
<p><li> To use an external style sheet, add a link to it in the < head> section of each HTML page.</li></p>
<p><li>The external style sheet can be written in any text editor. The file must not contain any HTML code, and must be saved with a .css extension.</li></P></ul>
<h2><b><i>8.HOW TO USE IN HTML DOCUMENT?</i></b></h2>
<P>Using CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) in an HTML document allows you to control the presentation and layout of your web pages. Here's a basic guide on how to use CSS in an HTML document:</p>
<p><b>Inline CSS:</b>
    Inline CSS is applied directly within the HTML element using the style attribute.</P>
<P><b>Internal CSS:</b>
    Internal CSS is placed within the < style> tag in the HTML< head> section.</P>
<p><b>Selectors:</b>
Selectors in CSS help you target specific HTML elements to apply styles.</p>
<h2><B><I>9.CSS SELECTOR AND THEIR TYPES</I></B></H2>
<P>CSS selectors are patterns that are used to select and style HTML elements. There are various types of selectors in CSS, each serving different purposes. Here are some common types of CSS selectors:</p>

<P><b>Element Selector:</b></p>

<p>Targets a specific HTML element.</p>
<div class="bordered">
<p>css
Copy code
p {
    /* styles for paragraphs */
}</p>
</div>
<p><b>Class Selector:</b></p>
<p>Targets elements with a specific class attribute.</p>
<div class="bordered">
<p>css
Copy code
.myClass {
    /* styles for elements with class="myClass" */
}</p>
</div>
<p><b>ID Selector:</b></p>
<p>Targets an element with a specific ID attribute.</p>
<div class="bordered">
<p>css
Copy code
#myID {
    /* styles for the element with id="myID" */
}</p>
</div>
<p><b>Attribute Selector:</b></p>
<p>Targets elements with a specific attribute.</p>
<div class="bordered">
<p>css
Copy code
input[type="text"] {
    /* styles for text input elements */
}</p>
</div>
<p><b>Descendant Selector:</b></p>
<p>Targets elements that are descendants of a specified element.</p>
<div class="bordered">
<p>css
Copy code
div p {
    /* styles for paragraphs within div elements */
}</p>
</div>
<p><b>Child Selector:</b></p>
<p>Targets direct children of a specified element.</p>
<div class="bordered">
<p>css
Copy code
ul > li {
    /* styles for list items that are direct children of ul elements */
}</p>
</div>
<p><b>Adjacent Sibling Selector:</b></p>
<p>Targets an element that is immediately preceded by a specified element.</p>
<div class="bordered">
<p>css
Copy code
h2 + p {
    /* styles for paragraphs that directly follow h2 elements */
}</p>
</div>
<p><b>Pseudo-class Selectors:</b></p>
<p>Targets elements based on their state or position.</p>
<div class="bordered">
<p>css
Copy code
a:hover {
    /* styles for links when hovered over */
}</p>
</div>
<p><b>Pseudo-element Selectors:</b></p>
<p>Targets specific parts of an element.</p>
<div class="bordered">
<p>css
Copy code
p::first-line {
    /* styles for the first line of paragraphs */
}</p>
</div>
<p><b>Grouping Selector:</b></p>
<p>Groups multiple selectors together to apply the same styles.</p>
<div class="bordered">
<p>css
Copy code
h1, h2, h3 {
    /* styles for multiple heading elements */
}</p>
</div>
<p>These are just some of the many CSS selectors available. Understanding and using selectors effectively allows you to apply styles to specific elements and create a well-designed and consistent layout for your web pages.</P>
